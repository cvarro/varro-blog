 ## Thoughts while reading the internets...

[This article prompted a few thoughts](https://cutlefish.substack.com/p/tbm-217-why-are-you-doing-this-wrong)...

As leaders, one of the most powerful questions we can ask ourselves is, "What are we working on right now, and why is it the most important thing we could be working on?" But simply asking the question isn't enough.

Far too often, the brief response from senior leaders is, "Our competitors are doing it," "It will generate immediate volume!" or "This will be a big win for Sales." (spoiler alert, these are usually bad answers)

Effective leaders foster an environment where respectful pushback and explaining "the why" are supported. Sure, disagreeing and committing is equally important, but we should also make sure we have good and thorough answers to this core question.
